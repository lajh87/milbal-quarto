# NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION

## (A) Allied Command, Europe

Allied Command has its headquarters near Paris and stretches from northern Norway to the southern frontiers of Turkey and the Mediterranean. The Air Forces in Europe of the NATO Powers can muster 5,000 tactical aircraft which operate from some 220 operational bases. Nearly 5,000 miles of fuel supply systems are in service for the supply of the forces, 26,500 miles of communications and signal network are in use, and an effective early warning radar system has been developed. Deployment of tactical nuclear weapons into NATO land forces is now almost complete. They are principally the Honest John missile, but include some Corporals and 280 mm. cannon. Joint production in European NATO countries of two anti-aircraft weapons Hawk and Side- winder is continuing, as well as three types of aircraft, the F104G Starfighter, the Breguet Atlantic, and the Fiat G91 light fighters.

Allied Command Europe is divided into the following subordinate commands:

(i) Allied Forces Central Europe has its headquarters in Fontainebleau and com- prises 23 divisions (out of the required 30) assigned to the Supreme Commander as follows:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| United Kingdom | 3 | |
| United States | 5 | (plus 3 armoured brigades and 13 Hawk battalions) |
| France | 2 | |
| Germany | 8 | (a ninth is forming) |
| Belgium | 2 | |
| Netherlands | 2 | |
| Canada | 1 | (brigade) |

Out of these forces, a small mobile task force of 5 battalions with a nuclear capability has been created as a tactical reserve for NATO as a whole.

The tactical air forces available in the central area consist of some 3,000 aircraft, of which 250 US fighter-bombers and a smaller number of British Canberras, now being replaced by Vulcan 2s, and Valiants have a nuclear capability and a range which would cover important sections of eastern Russia.

The tactical air forces are organized into two main commands, 2nd ATAF (under British command) in northern Germany, which includes British, Dutch, Belgian and German forces; 4th ATAF (under Ameri- can command) in southern Germany, in- cludes American, Canadian, French and German forces.

(ii) Allied Forces Northern Europe has its headquarters at Kolsaas in Norway and is responsible for the defence of Norway, Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein and the Baltic approaches. It comprises approximately one Norwegian and one Danish division, as well as the tactical air forces of these countries and their naval forces. One German division in Schleswig-Holstein and units of the German Baltic fleet are also committed to AFNORTH.

(iii) Allied Forces Southern Europe has its headquarters in Naples and is responsible for the defence of the Mediterranean NATO area. The forces allocated to this command comprise 14 divisions from Tur- key, 9 from Greece and 7 from Italy, as well as the tactical air forces of these countries which comprise some 1,000 aircraft, and some naval forces. US forces in Italy and Greece also operate some Honest John guided missile units in conjunction with national forces. The US Sixth Fleet would come under command of AFSOUTH in time of war.

(iv) Allied Forces Mediterranean has its headquarters at Malta and is primarily responsible for safeguarding communica- tions through and across the Mediterranean. Six areas are under national control, two British, one French, one Italian, one Greek, one Turkish. There is also a special subor- dinate command for submarine forces in the Mediterranean. The national fleets of Italy, Greece and Turkey, together with a propor- tion of the British and - normally the French fleets, go to make up this command.

## (B) Allied Command, Atlantic

Unlike the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic does not have forces permanently assigned to him in peacetime. The eight NATO maritime powers bordering the Atlantic maintain control of their forces in peacetime, but have earmarked certain of them for SACLANT in the event of war.

Broadly speaking, in wartime, SACLANT's missions are to strike at enemy naval bases and airfields with aircraft from the Striking Fleet Atlantic, to main- tain control of the Atlantic sea lanes, to prevent enemy forces from striking at European and North American land bases from the sea, and to support the Allied Command Europe. To the Striking Fleet Atlantic would be assigned a considerable proportion of American and British attack aircraft carriers.

(1) The surface ships in the navies of the eight Atlantic maritime nations include about 25 aircraft carriers. Of these, six American carriers have been converted for anti-submarine duties. Britain has 3 carriers, France, Canada and the Nether- lands have one each. The carriers designated for anti-submarine missions carry American and/or Canadian S2F Trackers, British Fairey Gannets, largely replaced by Sea Vixens, and Scimitars and Wessex helicopters, French 1050 Alizes and anti-submarine helicopters. In all, NATO anti-submarine carriers could embark about 400 to 500 aircraft of various types.

(2) Other surface ships in these national navies include about 440 destroyers, frigates and destroyer escorts. (The United States has over 260 of these types, the Royal Navy has over 47 to contribute, while the other navies have lesser numbers.) A considerable proportion of these anti-submarine ships are of World War II construction but many have been modernized and progress is being made in building replacements.

(3) With regard to submarines the trend in most navies has been to change their role from commerce destruction to anti-submarine warfare, although they retain the former mission in addition. Of the 16 nuclear and 243 conventional submarines belonging to NATO maritime countries, well over 150 would be available for anti-submarine duties in the Atlantic.

The surface and submarine forces are supported by long-range patrol aircraft such as the American Neptune, the British Shackleton, and Canadian Argus. In all, there are about 375 maritime patrol aircraft available for anti-submarine service in the eight NATO countries bordering the Atlantic.



## (C) The Channel Command

The role of Channel Command is to exercise maritime control of the English Channel and southern North Sea, to deny it to the enemy, to protect the sea lines of communication and to support operations conducted by SACLANT and SACEUR. To this end, Channel Command has at its disposal a considerable proportion of the national naval forces of Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

### Norad

North American Air Defence Command is maintained under an agreement between the United States and Canada, which integrates the Canadian and American Air Defence Commands. The Headquarters are at Colorado Springs. Canadian Air Defence Command currently has nine squadrons of CF-100 interceptors armed with air-to-air missiles. American Air Defence Command weapons consist of F-104 all-weather interceptors and Bomarc missiles. The defence of American cities depends mainly on 15 Nike-Hercules ground-to-air missile units. In 1962, Canada should receive 2 Bomarc missile units for which the sites in Quebec and Ontario, are ready, and for the opera- tion of which 500 men have been trained. These defences are supported by an ex- tended radar system. Supplementing the BMEWS station in Greenland and Alaska, there are three lines of radar stations in Canada, and the 'contiguous radar system' in the United States is supported by ships and radar aircraft in the Pacific and the Atlantic and a number of 'Texas Tower' radar stations near the Atlantic coast.

The Navy consists of 819 operational ships (383 warships, 232 combatants and 204 auxiliaries) at the end of 1961. 

These are organized into four fleets (1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th), each of which includes attack carriers, anti-submarine carriers, surface and sub-surface anti-submarine forces, cruisers, and associated logistic and amphibious forces.

The attack carriers Constellation and Kitty Hawk have been commissioned and the Navy has received the nuclear-powered attack carrier Enterprise and the nuclear-powered cruiser Long Beach. 

Seventeen new destroyers and frigates armed with guided missiles have joined the fleet in recent years and 28 more are under construction.

The Navy has 21 nuclear-powered submarines in service, six of which are fleet ballistic missile submarines.

In August 1961, the Navy announced that it would operate one additional attack carrier and air group. 22 amphibious ships and 11 fleet support ships are also to be reactivated. The Navy will operate one additional support carrier and air group for anti-submarine warfare purposes and purchase additional air and surface launched guided missiles.
