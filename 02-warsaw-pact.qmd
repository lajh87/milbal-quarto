## THE WARSAW PACT NATIONS

It is estimated that the seven Soviet satellites can muster about 68 regular divisions, mainly of the conventional type. These satellites' armed forces represent a total of about 990,300 men under arms (a significant in- crease over 1960), and in addition there are about 360,000 men in paramilitary formations.

The following are the estimated strength of their armed forces with their total population in brackets:

| Country      | Armed Force | Population   |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Poland | 255,000 |  (29,731,000) |
| Romania | 222,000 | (18,403,000) |
| Czechoslovakia | 185,000 | (13,649,000) |
| Bulgaria 120,000 | (7,867,000) |
| East Germany[^1] | 100,000     | (16,213,000) |
| Hungary      | 80,500      | (10,002,000) |
| Albania      | 27,800      | (1,607,000)  |

The satellite air forces number a total of about 2,900 planes, about 80 per cent of which are jet fighters.

The satellite naval forces are of little importance and only of value for local defence.

[^1]: The population of East Germany is 17,298,000 if East Berlin is included. The figure for its armed forces may rise markedly during the coming year as a result of conscription and if para-military formations such as the 75,000 man Bereitschaftspolizei are incorporated into the regular forces.
