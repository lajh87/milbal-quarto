"32","'2","'Text 5","'Throughout 1960 and the first half of 1961 the Soviet military policy followed the same course as that pursued by the United States in the mid-1950s and by Britain after 1957: an attempt was made to absorb the cost of technological development and new weapons by placing increased emphasis on nuclear fire power and reducing the amount of mobilized manpower. It was clear that the Soviet government had, at the end of 1959, reached a considered decision that their progress in missile technology, coupled with the demands of the economy, especially agriculture, for more men, justified such a policy. However, during July 1961, the Soviet government announced, in response to its own estimate of a darkening inter- national horizon, a revision of this emphasis on the deterrent effect of nuclear missiles, and has been anxious since then to make clear that it is building up the strength of virtually all its forces except surface ships. Under the law of January 15, 1960, the Soviet forces were to be reduced from 3,623,000 men to 2,423,000 men by the end of 1961, a reduction of 1,200,000 men over two years, but its suspension was announced on July 8, 1961. No official Soviet figures of the current strength of the forces has been published but it is not likely that more than 600,000 men were demobilized, principally in the ground forces. Thus the total strength of the forces in mid-1961 was about 3,000,000 men. In addition, it was announced on August 29, 1961, that the demobilization of certain categories of other ranks, whose period of military service was completed, had been suspended until the signature of a German peace treaty. When men called up in 1961 have completed their training and been absorbed into units at the end of the year, the effect of this decree (unless it is rescinded) will be to increase the size of the Soviet forces by up to 800,000 men, giving","'11","'34.59472656","04597226108459673/layout.csv"

In real terms, the total size of the augmented Soviet budget is estimated to be of the order of between $20,000 and $25,000 million. It is not likely that all this one-third increase can be spent during 1961, and only part of it will be needed to meet the increased bill for man- power; this suggests that it is also intended to accelerate weapons development and production.","'13","'97.02148438","04597226108459673/layout.csv"
