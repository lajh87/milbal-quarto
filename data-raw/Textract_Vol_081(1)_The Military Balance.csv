"13","'2","'Text 7","'It examines the facts of military power as they existed in July 1981, and no projections of force levels or weapons beyond this date have been included, except where specifically stated. The study should not therefore be regarded as a comprehensive guide to the balance of mili- tary power; in particular, it does not reflect the facts of geography, doctrine or efficiency, except where these are explicitly touched upon.","'12","'96.28906250","04597228108459909/layout.csv"
"14","'2","'Text 8","'The book is organized in three sections. National entries are in general grouped geograph- ically, but with special reference to the principal regional defence pacts and alignments. Information about some smaller countries, whose military forces are of a size which has not seemed to warrant fuller description at this stage, has been set out in a tabular form. Tables give comparative information on nuclear delivery vehicles and static measurements of the strategic nuclear balance, defence expenditure (with historical trends), military manpower (active and reserve) and arms-transfer agreements. New in this year's edition are a description of chemical warfare agents, and a sketch map of the Chinese People's Republic's Military Regions and Districts. Separate essays assess the European theatre balance, both conventional and nuclear, between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. There essays go beyond the purely statis- tical presentation of military forces.","'13","'96.82617188","04597228108459909/layout.csv"

An alphabetical list, show- ing where each country entry is to be found, is on p. 2, following these notes. To the extent that national variations permit, each country entry (with the exception of those for some smaller countries) is arranged in a standard form: general information about population, military service, total military manpower strength, Gross National Product (GNP) and defence expenditure; separate sections on the army, navy, and air force, with broad organization and equipment and, where relevant, the foreign deployment of forces of a significant size and main naval bases. Where the information is available, reserves and para- military forces are included. It is not easy to make precise distinctions as to what are or are not para- military forces, and some latitude must be allowed in definition. In general, however, para-military forces are here taken to be forces whose equipment and training goes beyond that required for civil police duties and whose constitution and control suggest they may be usable in support, or in lieu, of regular forces.","'13","'99.21875000","04597228108459910/layout.csv"

Table 4 on p. 112 shows current and past expenditures, expressed in current United States dollars so as to afford international com- parisons; however, since many countries update these each year, the figures will not necessarily correspond with those shown in previous editions of The Military Balance. In Table 2 there are compari- sons of NATO defence expenditures 1961-1980 in current and constant prices; in this table, and for the NATO countries in Table 4, a standard NATO definition of defence expenditure is used, but in most other cases national definitions are used. The defence expenditures of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are a range of estimates illustrating the variation of opinion as to these expenditures. The problem of arriving at Soviet defence expenditure and an exchange rate to afford comparability is discussed on pp. 14-15, whilst a note on p. 75 covers the difficulty of arriving at a figure for China.","'17","'97.75390625","04597228108459910/layout.csv"

GNP figures are usually quoted at current market prices (factor cost for East European countries). Where figures are not currently available from published sources, estimates have been made, and Table 4 uses both published and estimated GNP figures. Wherever possible, the United Nations System of National Accounts has been used, rather than national figures, as a step towards greater comparability. For the Soviet Union GNP estimates are made in roubles, following R.W. Campbell, 'A Shortcut Method for Estimating Soviet GNP' (Association for Comparative Economic Studies, vol. XIV, no.2, Fall 1972). East European GNPS at factor cost are derived from Net Material Product, using an adjustment parameter from T.P. Alton, 'Economic Growth and Resource Allocation in Eastern Europe', Reorientation and Commercial Relations of the Economies of Eastern Europe, Joint Economic Committee, 93rd Congress, 2nd Session (Washington DC: USGPO, 1974). For the People's Republic of China two estimates of GNP have been given in a note on p. 75.","'19","'97.85156250","04597228108459910/layout.csv"

An exception has been made in the case of the Soviet Union, since the official exchange rate is unsuitable for converting rouble estimates of GNP. Various estimates of more appropriate conversion rates have been made, but they have shortcomings too great to warrant their being used here; the official rate is, however, given in the country section. Further exceptions are certain East European countries which are not members of the IMF and Romania (which is), for which the conversion rates used are those described in Alton's study mentioned above.","'21","'97.55859375","04597228108459910/layout.csv"

The declared Soviet defence budget is thought to exclude a number of elements such as military R&D, stockpiling and civil defence - indeed some contend that it covers only the operating and military construction costs of the armed forces. The problem of arriving at a current budgetary figure was discussed in The Military Balance 1973-1974, pp. 8-9, and on pp. 109-110 of the 1976-1977 edition. The official defence budget for 1980 of 17.1 bn roubles equals about 6% of the total government expenditure, or 2.8% of GNP, according to non-Soviet estimates of the latter.","'436","'85.59570313","04597228108459912/layout.csv"
"504","'14","'Text 359","'Furthermore, Soviet pricing practices are quite different from those in the West. Objectives are set in real terms with no requirement for money prices to coincide with the real costs of goods and services. The rouble cost of the defence effort may thus not reflect the real cost of alternative production forgone, and in turn a rouble value of defence expressed as a percentage of Soviet GNP measured in roubles may not reflect the true burden.","'437","'78.12500000","04597228108459912/layout.csv"

"506","'14","'Text 361","'An alternative approach - estimating how much it would cost to produce and man the equivalent of the Soviet defence effort in the USA - produces the index number problem: faced with the American price structure, the Soviet Union might opt for a pattern of spending different from her present one.

This Council meets infrequently to supervise the work of the Permanent Joint High Command (JHC). That Command is headed by a Soviet Marshal, who is also the Soviet First Deputy Minister of Defence. Each Pact Defence Ministry has a senior general as a permanent representative on the JHC staff, while a Soviet general is assigned to each national HQ, except in Romania. The Staff is responsible for operational plans and for managing the Pact field exercises. The Pact military representatives also form the Mili- tary Council which, chaired by the C-in-C, and including the C of S, advises the JHC on non- operational matters, and controls the Central Administration for training, standardization and, possibly, technical affairs. The offices of C-in-C and C of S and all important staff posts have always been held by Soviet officers.","'17","'96.04492188","04597228108459913/layout.csv"

The Paris Agreements of 1954 added a Protocol aimed at strengthening the NATO structure and revised the Brussels Treaty, to enable West Germany and Italy to join it. The Treaty had no date of termination. France withdrew from the military organization in 1966; Greece, which left in 1974, has now rejoined it.

Iraq and Syria concluded defence pacts in May 1968 and July 1969, and a third, calling for full military union, in October 1978. Little of substance resulted, and unification seems to have been abandoned following a dispute in July 1979. Jordan and Syria later set up a joint consultative body - now presumed to be in abeyance - to co-ordinate military policy. The Federation of Arab Republics, formed by Libya, Syria and Egypt in April 1971, provided for a common defence policy and a Federal Defence Council, and an Egyptian was appointed Commander-in-Chief of all Federation Forces in January 1973. This agreement was not actively implemented and must be presumed to be in abeyance.

"2846","'2","'Text 4","'Chinese defence policy has for many years maintained a balance, at times uneasy, between the two concepts of nuclear deterrence and People's War. The former aims to deter strategic attack, the latter, by mass mobilization of the population, to deter or repel conventional land invasion. Mao's death in September 1976 and the subsequent attacks on the 'Gang of Four' removed the strongest, but not the only, supporters of the strategic concept that mass man- power was the primary deterrent. There are indications of an effort to develop more modern general-purpose forces in order to meet more limited military contingencies than the extremes of nuclear deterrence or mass war.","'13","'98.29101563","04597228108459916/layout.csv"
"2847","'2","'Text 5","'The conventional arms inventory of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) generally falls behind that of nations with advanced technology. However, as one of the Four Modern- izations, China's defence is due for gradual updating. This will involve, in many cases, the replacement of Soviet or Soviet-designed equipment. Indigenous designs and Western tech- nology and equipment will be more widely used. In June 1981 the United States agreed in principle to sell arms to China, in addition to the logistic and dual-use equipment and tech- nology agreed under the Carter Administration. This has added to China's potential sources of supply. But the current phase of economic readjustment has meant a 20% cut in the defence budget - and possibly in manpower also - and the process of modernization is likely to be quite slow (see the note on defence expenditure which follows the country entry).","'14","'97.46093750","04597228108459916/layout.csv"

The stockpile of weapons, both fission and fusion, is believed to amount to several hundreds and probably will continue to grow. Fighter aircraft could be used for tactical delivery, and for longer ranges there is the B-6/Tu-16 medium bomber, with a radius of action up to 3,000 km. MRBM with a range of some 1,800 km are operational but may be replaced by IRBM, also operational now, with a range of about 2,500 km.

A successful full-range test took place in May 1980. The missile has been successfully used (and thus tested) as a launcher for satellites. China has also one G-class submarine with missile launching tubes, but does not appear to have missiles for it. All the present missiles are liquid- fuelled.

Amendments (Rio, 1965; Bogotá, 1966) reiterated the goal of peaceful settlement of disputes. In 1965-6 an Inter-American Peace Force was formed for service in the Dominican Republic. Subsequent attempts to create a per- manent force have failed, but an Inter-American Defence Board has been formed to co- ordinate planning. Declarations condemning Communism in the Western Hemisphere, signed in Bogotá in 1948 by 17 nations (Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic and the US abstain- ing), were reiterated at Caracas (1954, 1973), San José (1960), Punta del Este (1962) and Wash- ington (1972). In 1962 the Foreign Ministers and, later, the Council excluded Cuba. In 1975 the OAS agreed to normalize relations with Cuba.","'15","'97.80273438","04597228108459917/layout.csv"

It must be set within the context of the strategic nuclear balance, of military forces world-wide and, in particular, of the relative strengths of the navies and long-range air forces of both sides.","'14","'98.29101563","04597228108459919/layout.csv"

The West has hitherto relied on its superior technology and - although there is evi- dence that the East has been catching up and, in some instances, has actually overtaken the West - some Western advantage still remains, though this is now much smaller than it was.","'15","'98.38867188","04597228108459919/layout.csv"

(For conven- ience, Europe in this case is assumed to exclude the territory of the Soviet Union.) However, in the event of hostilities erupting or threatening to erupt, two kinds of augmentation can take place: first, standing forces not in Europe can be moved there; second, reserve forces can be mobilized either for combat in place or in order to be moved to Europe by external powers.

"4444","'9","'Text 52","'Comparison of the two halves of the table at the end of this essay shows that, if Poseidon is excluded from the calculations, the Warsaw Pact relies more heavily on the missile element of its theatre nuclear systems (70% of arriving warheads) than NATO (55%); but if Poseidon is included, the NATO percentage rises to 78%. It is also significant that the Warsaw Pact's aircraft appear to be better able to survive and penetrate to their targets than NATO'S, as shown by the judgment that 29% of Pact air-delivered warheads are expected to survive and arrive at their targets, against 23% for NATO. This reflects the facts that Soviet aircraft are generally newer than NATO'S and that Pact air defences are somewhat denser.","'85","'97.80273438","04597228108459919/layout.csv"

This emphasizes the critical nature of the assumption as to whether or not to include Poseidon warheads. Neverthe- less, even with the inclusion of Poseidon on the Western side and the continued exclusion of Soviet strategic systems, the balance is distinctly un- favourable to NATO and is becoming more so. The Soviet SS-20 programme, intended to replace the older SS-4 and SS-5 missiles, has continued, result- ing in an increase in Pact warhead numbers based on more survivable launchers. It is not clear that all SS-4s and SS-5s will be taken out of operation once the SS-20 deployment is complete, although the numbers of the older missiles are falling stead- ily. However, nothing has yet been done to reduce substantially the vulnerability of NATO'S existing nuclear delivery systems or to increase their ability to penetrate Pact defences. Improvement in both respects must await the implementation of NATO's decision of December 1979 to deploy long-range ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCM) and 108 Pershing II MRBM in Europe, a programme un- likely to be completed before the end of the decade.","'86","'97.36328125","04597228108459919/layout.csv"

They must not be confused with bacteriological agents which owe their effects to the multiplication of their organ- isms within the victim. Chemical agents may be grouped, according to their effects on human tar- gets, into six main categories: incapacitating, vomiting, choking, blood, blister, and nerve agents. Chemical herbicides and smoke and flame weapons are frequently included under the chemical agent heading in literature on the subject but, since their effects are not directed primarily against human targets, they will be excluded from consideration here. An additional category - irritants - does not come under the definition of chemical agents under the Geneva Protocol of 1925, nor are irritants normally used in war. They are, however, used extensively in police and inter- nal security operations. In that context they fall within the technical description of chemical agents cited above, and they are therefore included in the present listing.","'118","'99.16992188","04597228108459919/layout.csv"
