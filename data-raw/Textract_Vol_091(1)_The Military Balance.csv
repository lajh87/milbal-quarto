Then The Military Balance strength estimates of effective reservists are based on the numbers available within five years of completing full-time service, unless there is good evidence that obligations are enforced for longer.

"205","'9","'Text 54","'Each year the US government presents its Defense Budget to Congress for the next two fiscal years, together with a long- term spending plan covering a further three years. Until approved by Congress the Budget is referred to as the Budget Request, after approval it becomes the Budget Authority (BA), and authorizes funds for immediate and future disburse- ment. The term Total Obligational Authority (TOA) represents the value of direct defence programmes for each fiscal year regardless of financing (i.e. from previous fiscal years and receipts from earned income or interest). The term 'out- lay' represents actual expenditure; each year the government estimates what the outlay will be, the difference between this and the BA providing for contingencies. However, moneys authorized, particularly in the procurement and con- struction areas, are rarely all spent in the year of authorization, though contracts are signed which commit the govern- ment to payment in future years. On average, carried forward authorities constitute some 40% of each year's outlay, while similarly some 40% of each year's BA will be carried forward to future years.","'82","'99.07226563","04597229108460027/layout.csv"

It had been known for some time that tanks were being moved across the Urals out of the Treaty area (The Military Balance assessed the number as some 7,000 at 1 June 1990) but the data figures showed, when compared with earlier data exchanges, that many more items had been transferred. It was also noted that three motor rifle divisions (MRD) and three artillery brigades/regiments had been resubordinated to the Navy for coastal defence, and Soviet negotiators claimed that their 813 tanks, 972 ACV and 846 artillery pieces were not subject to CFE constraints. The same claim was made for some 1,700 ACV held by Strategic Rocket Forces. Western CFE negotiators were surprised to see that the number of objects of verification (OOV) (sites or groups of sites at which TLE are located and so liable to verification by inspection) declared by the Soviet Union was only 895, whereas they had been led to believe by senior members of the USSR delegation that around 1,600 OOVs would be notified. Finally, it was suspected that Soviet data was inaccurate and that it represented the position which would be reached after further TLE had been moved over the Urals. While none of these events violated the terms of CFE (the treaty does not come into effect until ratified), they did cause concern, and Western governments, led by the US and UK, declined to pass the treaty to their parliaments for ratification.","'13","'97.11914063","04597229108460028/layout.csv"

The first statement commits the USSR to holding tanks, ACVs and artillery below the maximum levels allowed (by the number it has in Coastal Defence Forces (the three resubordinated divisions) and Naval Infantry). Of the surplus created (that is 933 tanks, 1,725 ACVs and 1,080 artillery) 50% will be destroyed (with the exception of 753 MT-LB APCs which will be converted into 'look alike' models not counted under the Treaty), the remaining 50% being transferred out of the ATTU zone where an equal number of older types will be destroyed. In the statement to the Joint Consultative Group, the Soviet Union declared that between 1 January 1989 and 19 November 1990, 16,400 MBT, 15,900 ACVs and 25,000 pieces of artillery had been trans- ported east of the Urals. Of these the USSR committed itself to destroying (or converting into civil equipments) 6,000 tanks, 1,500 ACVs and 7,000 artillery. It also stated that it would not use transferred equipments to create strategic reserves or operational groupings, and, once the Treaty was in force, would notify all parties as to the locations of the TLE placed in storage or being used for replacement and repair. Once these issues had been resolved, it was possible to at least begin CFE la talks, which are to set manpower limits and to agree the ques- tion of aerial verification.","'14","'92.87109375","04597229108460028/layout.csv"

In the agreements the Soviet Union undertook to withdraw its armed forces from eastern Europe by the end of 1994. This withdrawal has already begun but has been handicapped by the lack of agreed terms for the use of Polish roads and railways and by the difficulties of providing housing in a timely fashion for the returning Soviet troops and their families. In return, the Soviet Union is to receive approximately DM 12bn by way of stationing, transportation and housing costs. The Soviet Union has also agreed in principle to withdraw its forces from Poland, but as yet no final date for the withdrawal to be completed has been agreed; the USSR is looking towards the end of 1993, while Poland holds out for an earlier date. The first troops to be withdrawn, a Scud SSM brigade, left in April 1991. The Soviet withdrawals from Hungary agreed to in March 1990 and from Czechoslovakia (Febru- ary 1990) were completed on schedule by the end of June 1991.","'19","'98.97460938","04597229108460028/layout.csv"

At that time 36 launchers had been mounted on 12 trains which were deployed at three sites. It is estimated that about a further 54 SS-24 have been deployed in former SS-19 silos. SS-25 deployment has probably now reached 300; the missile was seen for the first time at the October Day Parade held on 7 November 1990. It is reliably claimed that follow-ons to both SS-24 and SS-25 are under development. While the deployed numbers of SS-18 remained at 308, more have been modernized with the ten-warhead Mod 5 and a new single-warhead Mod 6 replacing older Mod 2, 3 and 4 missiles. Other types of older silo-based ICBMs have been retired during the year including: 50 SS-11 Mod 2, 20 SS-13, 25 SS-17 and 20 SS-19. It is expected that the remaining missiles of these types will be eliminated. A spokesman announced that, by 23 November 1990, over 40 ICBM launch silos had been destroyed in the Novgorod Oblast (Leningrad Military District); these are likely to have been SS-17 silos. No new SSBN have been brought into service, though the seventh Delta-IV has been launched. The last two Golf- II and one Yankee-I have been decommissioned. No SSBN are now operating in the Baltic. It is reported that three new types of SLBM are under development, and that the Typhoon-class SSBN is being modified to take one of these.

Other withdrawals from WGF include the air assault brigade, the Spetsnaz brigade and the pipe-line brigade. The withdrawal programme has been announced by the C-in-C WGF as being 25-30% of the Group in 1991 (perhaps two further divisions this year), 30% in both 1992 and 1993, and the final 10% in 1994. On 5 March 1991 he said that 5,000 tanks, 620 combat aircraft and 790 helicopters remained in Germany (somewhat surprisingly as the CFE-declared total of tanks in WGF was 4,116 on 19 November 1990).

The Military Balance has knowledge of at least ten divisions, (seven tank and three motor rifle), that have been dis- banded in the last 12 months; the number could be higher. In December 1990 Colonel Gen- eral Kolesnikov, Commander Ground Forces, stated that 31 tank and motor rifle divisions had been disbanded (but this statement obviously included divisions disbanded before June 1990 and those outside the ATTU). CFE data shows that there are a number of training div- isions, some of which include active force elements, and these have been counted as reserve divisions. Two other types of formation, not previously identified have been listed in the data: Rear Area Security Divisions, which appear to be infantry with no armoured or artillery assets (they could be former MRD stripped of their CFE TLE); there are also units entitled 'motor rifle substitute division' or 'anti-tank substitute brigade' etc., which are understood to be manpower pool units to provide battle casualty replacements. There are a number of 'arms and equipment storage depots', which, while not containing the full equipment holding for a whole division, do contain most of the main components: tanks, APCs, Command Post and other armoured 'look alike' vehicles, artillery, and armoured vehicle launched bridges (although not always sufficient APCs and artillery to equip a division). These could be the equipment packs for mobilization divisions. There could be as many as 13 of these mobiliz- ation packs: 1 in Belorussia, 4 in Kiev, 2 in Moscow, 2 in Volga/Urals and 4 in Leningrad MDs. The Leningrad depots contain few tanks (40), PT-76 light tanks (39 each) and MT-LB; it is interesting to note that active MRD in the Leningrad MD are equipped with 40 tanks, 39 PT-76 plus rather more MT-LB and artillery than these depots contain. In the Trans- Caucasus MD there are also a number of 'fortified areas', each with two machine gun (MG)/ artillery battalions. These have no CFE TLE, so are not well armed. They could be the start of the formation of MG/artillery divisions of which there are three in the Far East TVD and which Marshall Yazov announced, on 28 February 1989, would be formed from some","'34","'96.77734375","04597229108460028/layout.csv"

In the WGF three (out of seven) tank divisions had converted to the two tank, two motor rifle regiment (MRR) structure by the end of 1990, and five (of six) MRD were on the four MRR organization. The reorganization may have only been intended for the Groups of Forces as elsewhere in the ATTU only four other MRD are on the new establishment (three in the Trans-Caucasus MD and one which had been withdrawn from CGF). Although a num- ber of others have no tank regiment, they do not, as yet, have a fourth MRR. Most of these restructured MRDs have an independent tank battalion (a unit previously noted only in the Groups of Forces). Soviet data shows that tank holdings in the ATTU have dropped from 41,580 in January 1989 to 20,725 in November 1990, this latter figure does not include 813 in the three MRD resubordinated to Coastal Defence, nor 120 with Naval Infantry. It would seem that over 4,000 tanks have been destroyed; they are being broken up and melted down at Novosibirsk, Barnaul and Novokuznetsk. Several hundred have been converted for civil use. It has been repeatedly stated by Soviet spokesmen that 8,000 tanks have been sent to the Far East where they will be used to complete understrength unit holdings and to replace older models which will then be destroyed. 8,400 more are reported to be in storage in Western Siberia and Central Asia.","'38","'98.82812500","04597229108460028/layout.csv"

In the Carpathian MD, there is an artillery corps comprising: an artillery division of five regiments, an SSM brigade, a target acquisition regi- ment and two anti-tank brigades. There is no standard organization for artillery divisions but most include at least three gun/howitzer and one MRL brigades/regiments and an anti- tank regiment. The Military Balance 1989-1990 reported the formation of heavy artillery brigades (with 203mm SP guns 2S7 and 240mm SP mortars 2S4), there appear to be only five of these brigades in the ATTU and none in the Groups of Forces (all have 48 2S7); in the April 1990 artillery data exchange in Vienna, the Soviet Union declared 347 2S7 and 346 2S4, sufficient to equip 14 brigades. There is only one unit equipped with 2S4 SP, an artillery brig- ade in the North Caucasus MD. Nearly 300 2S4 have been moved east of the Urals.

Although the Soviet armed forces have reduced in strength by about 450,000 of the 500,000 announced by President Gorbachev, they are some 340,000 men below the new planned manning level. There are two reasons for the shortage. First, conscription targets have not been met in those republics presently seeking indepen- dence from the USSR. In 1990, a total of some 130,000 men failed to report for military ser- vice (compared with 1,000 in 1988 and nearly 7,000 in 1989). It is reported that some repub- lics only produced a low percentage of their conscript quota for the spring 1991 call-up: Lithuania (12.3%), Latvia (30.8%), Estonia (30.3%), Armenia (16.5%) and Georgia (8.1%). A special agreement was reached between the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union and the gov- ernment of the Uzbek Republic regarding conscript service. In return for a determined drive to achieve manpower targets it was agreed that deferment could be granted to men whose brothers were already serving. Only volunteers would be sent to the Trans-Caucasus MD and Black Sea Fleet, and conscripts from Uzbekistan would be given longer periods of leave and a pay increase. Second, both manpower numbers and quality have been affected by the decision not to conscript higher education students. As a result of this decision there has been a far higher rate of application for further education and it is estimated that 90,000 fewer women gained places.","'52","'97.41210938","04597229108460028/layout.csv"

Officially, the military budget for 1991 has been pegged at R 96.563bn (nearly two billion roubles less than the sum requested by the gov- ernment), of which 40% was earmarked for arms procurement.

In effect, the size of the economy is given in the traditional NMP, in roubles, and in GNP, which is derived from the Soviet Defence Ministry's baseline estimate to the same effect, in roubles and $US.

"846","'2","'Text 6","'It has been a significant 12 months for NATO: the signing of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty (CFE); the unification of Germany within the Atlantic Alliance; the reduction of the Soviet threat brought about by the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the agree- ments to withdraw all Soviet armed forces from eastern Europe. As a result of these changes NATO has embarked on a review of its strategy, operational plans and deployment. NATO first signalled its intentions with the London Declaration of 6 July 1990 which stated that 'NATO will prepare a new Allied military strategy moving away from ""forward defence"" where appropriate, towards a reduced forward presence and modifying ""flexible response"" to reflect a reduced reliance on nuclear weapons' and 'a new NATO strategy making nuclear forces truly weapons of last resort'.","'12","'98.73046875","04597229108460029/layout.csv"
"847","'2","'Text 7","'The initial euphoria induced by the end of the Cold War, however, has not yet resulted in a military. reorganization in Western Europe. A number of new factors have complicated the scene: virtually all NATO members have embarked on reviews of their armed forces and their contribution to NATO; most are set on making significant force reductions, and treasuries are seeking an elusive, so-called 'peace dividend'. SHAPE has been developing its plans for a restructured NATO force but these have been stymied to some extent by the emerging contro- versy over the shape of European security and whether the EC should develop common foreign and defence policies, in addition to economic and political union. SHAPE is waiting to be informed about the final structure of national forces and member nations are waiting to know what NATO's plans are and what is expected of them. All this has been further compli- cated by the Gulf War and the re-emergence of possible 'out of area' (OOA) roles for multinational standby forces. If not deployed under NATO command, these forces could be 'double hatted' and earmarked for European-sponsored operations (possibly under WEU control) as well as for NATO or national roles.","'13","'97.46093750","04597229108460029/layout.csv"

"849","'2","'Text 9","'At the NATO Defence Planning Committee meeting on 28 and 29 May 1991 a general outline and some details of how NATO's Central Region would be structured were given, pending the outcome of NATO's strategy review planned for November 1991. There would be four types of forces: immediate reaction; rapid reaction; main defences; and augmentation. The immediate reaction force would be modelled on the ACE Mobile Force and would con- tain as many national contingents as possible so as to increase its political profile; in peace- time, units in the ACE Mobile Force are already committed to SACEUR and so theoretically can be deployed without lengthy political discussion. The rapid reaction force would be a multinational corps based on those elements of the 1st British Corps which will remain in Germany. It may comprise four divisions: a British armoured division of three brigades based in Germany; a British division based in the UK which would include the airborne brigade, two mechanized brigades and, when necessary, the commando brigade; a multinational air mobile division with brigades found by the UK, Germany and the Netherlands with a Belgian element; and a Southern Flank division, whose detailed composition has not yet been announced, probably commanded by an Italian. The Corps would be commanded by a British General. It would be available for operations throughout NATO and it is possible that some form of 'double hatting' may be introduced to allow the corps, or at any rate major elements of it, to be prepared for OOA operations not under NATO command. All units in the Corps would be active though there will still be conscripts in most units other than the British. The main defence forces will be both active and reserve.

France was severely restricted in the size of force that it could deploy by the political decision not to send conscripts to the Middle East. Although the UK has all volunteer forces it also faced manpower problems as many units were understrength and others (particularly artil- lery) rely heavily on reservists to expand from peace to war establishment. Reservists would normally provide all the manpower needed to form battle casualty replacement units, and the Territorial Army (TA) provides the bulk of the medical and transport units which reinforce the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) in wartime. Only medical reservists were recalled for service in the Gulf, some TA and reserves volunteered for a special engagement, and the Reg- ular Army provided the remainder of the shortfall. The British armoured division which deployed to the Gulf with only two brigades plus logistic support took nearly half the man- power of BAOR (an eight brigade sized force). If NATO or a European defence organization is to form a rapid reaction force with OOA roles it must address these two manning problems: volunteer versus conscript forces; and reliance on reserve forces.","'22","'97.46093750","04597229108460029/layout.csv"

Four SSBN remain operational, one (Le Foudroyant) remains in long refit (completion due in early 1993) and Le Triomphant is still under construction and scheduled to be operational in 1994. France is in the process of reviewing the future of its nuclear triad, with a strong chance that only one delivery system (an IRBM or an air-launched stand-off missile) will be deployed alongside five rather than six SSBN. However, it has been decided that the S-3 SSM replacement will not be the mobile S-45 IRBM. The SSM component of France's 'prestrategic' nuclear forces is to be modernized, with a first Hadès regiment replacing Pluton in the spring of 1992. A second regiment is planned, but it is doubtful whether a third will be deployed. Pluton, currently deployed in five regiments, will be gradually phased out. France has indicated its decision to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The UK's Vanguard-class SSBN construction con- tinues on schedule with the third submarine being laid down in early 1991. There are fre- quent press reports of faults affecting the UK Polaris force which may comprise only one fully serviceable SSBN. A decision to replace free-fall nuclear bombs with a stand-off weapon has been delayed and must now be complicated by the uncertainty over the make-up of French nuclear forces. Following the withdrawal by the US of its nuclear warheads, Germany has destroyed all its 72 Pershing 1A SSM; it inherited some 20 SS-23 missiles from the NVA which are to be destroyed. There has been no progress towards instituting SNF treaty nego- tiations, but it is generally accepted that there is no longer a role for ground-launched nuclear weapons and that both SSM and artillery warheads should be withdrawn.","'30","'97.41210938","04597229108460029/layout.csv"

Only Romania, of the former Warsaw Pact states, has subsequently signed a Treaty on Co-operation, Good Neighbourliness and Friendship with the Soviet Union. This Treaty contains a clause pledging 'not to tolerate the use of their territories by a third state to commit an act of aggression against the other side and not to support such a state'; while other former Warsaw Pact states are ready to complete treaties of co-operation and friendship with the Soviet Union, they have all drawn the line at including such an undertaking. Meanwhile, a number of bilateral treaties have been signed: a Military Co-operation Agreement between Hungary and Poland allows for co-production, procurement and an officer training and exchange scheme; a symbolic statement was signed by the leaders of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland at Visegrad (where the kings of these countries had signed a co-operation agreement in 1335). The statement set out the intention to co-operate rather than compete in the economic field and foresaw the need to consult on matters of security.","'14","'96.58203125","04597229108460030/layout.csv"

The CFE Treaty con- tinues to link them together, and to the Soviet Union, in particular over holdings of treaty- limited equipment (TLE) and verification inspections. They must all eliminate relatively large numbers of tanks and artillery (many of them older types); most are reducing the size of their armed forces to cut defence spending; some are reducing the length of conscript service and others reserve training liability. Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland plan to reorientate their armed forces, whose deployment was required by the Warsaw Pact to be predominantly in the western part of these countries. The aim is to spread forces more evenly across the country; air defence must be reorientated to give a measure of all-round defence. These countries also have to deal with the environmental problems left by the departing Soviet forces, particularly the disposal of unexploded ammunition and waste oil.","'24","'97.21679688","04597229108460030/layout.csv"

Equipment holdings show a decrease of 60 MBT and increases in BMP (20) and APC (70 A-180 Sisu and 200 MT-LB).

"2580","'2","'Text 7","'The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 occurred just before The Military Balance 1990-1991 went to press. The background and course of the war have been fully described in Strategic Survey 1990-1991; the highlights only are repeated here. The invasion took six hours to complete and there was some fear that Iraqi forces might continue to advance southwards into Saudi Arabia. The Gulf Cooperation Council Military Agreement was shown to be inad- equate, and from the start the Arab League was divided, although it condemned the invasion. The US reacted promptly and its first forces were deployed to Saudi Arabia on 7 August. The United Nations imposed a sanctions regime on Iraq and Kuwait on 6 August. An impressive build-up of military force took place over the next six months. Code-named Operation Desert Shield, it consisted of forces predominantly from the US, but with ground and air forces from France and the UK, and ground forces from a number of Arab, Muslim and other countries. Eventually 29 countries deployed forces to the Gulf region; full details are given on pp. 238-42. On 28 November 1990, the UN authorized the use of 'all necessary means' to regain Kuwait and 'to restore international peace and security in the area' if Iraq did not withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait by midnight on 15 January 1991. Iraq did not comply: Operation Desert Storm, the Coalition air offensive, began at 2am local time on 17 January. Some five weeks later, on 24 February, a massive ground offensive, Operation Desert Sabre, was launched at 4am local time, and a cease-fire was ordered 100 hours after that, at 8am on 28 February.","'14","'98.43750000","04597229108460031/layout.csv"
"2581","'2","'Text 8","'In Iraq the end of the war was followed by uprisings: by Shi'a Arabs in the south and Kurds in the north. Both insurgencies were ruthlessly crushed by the remains of the Iraqi Army, notably by those forces which had remained outside the theatre of the Coalition's ground operations. Repression resulted in a mass migration of refugees: the Shi'as fled to Iran and the marshland south-east of Basra; and the Kurds to the mountains on the Iraq-Turkey-Iran borders. Coalition forces remained aloof for some time until the pressure of public and political opinion led to the deployment of a new allied force, first to south-eastern Turkey and then into northern Iraq to establish safe havens for the Kurdish refugees in an operation known as Provide Com- fort. There were no serious clashes with Iraqi forces. Protracted negotiations followed between the Kurds and the Iraqi government on the establishment of an autonomous Kurdish region. The allies withdrew their forces from Iraq in mid-July and established a small multinational force backed by air power in Turkey as a deterrent to the renewed persecution of the Kurds. Coalition forces remain in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In the former, a US Armoured Cavalry Regiment and a battle group based on an infantry battalion from the UK provide a measure of deterrence until an Arab force can be established.

The Secretary-General and the IAEA were required to submit plans for on-site inspection and the destruction of all weapons of mass destruction. Iraq provided lists.

Iran was able to increase its oil exports; Egypt and Syria also gained financially as they received substan- tial aid from Saudi Arabia in return for deploying troops there; Egypt was also forgiven some $7bn debt by the US.

The Israelis are playing down Patriot's capability to ensure the continued develop- ment of their Arrow ATBM system, which would have a much longer engagement range than Patriot. The second stage of development has been authorized, but although the US is paying 72% of the cost, Israel is finding it an expensive project. The second phase will involve 11 test flights over the next 45 months. There have been a number of changes to the Naval order of battle. Four Saar 2 PFM have been retired and a fifth Saar 4.5 was commissioned. A new class of Saar, the 5, is starting construction in 1991. They will be armed with Gabriel, Harpoon and Barak SAM.

Several hundred anti-Gaddafi Libyans, who were being trained by the CIA, had to be withdrawn from Chad. In March 1991, the President of Mali, Moussa Traoré, was overthrown by the Army. In July, an attempted coup by a group of Army officers was foiled by elements of the Army loyal to the new President, Amadou Touré. For the first time since decolonization, two governments, in Benin and Cape Verde, changed as the result of free elections.","'19","'97.26562500","04597229108460032/layout.csv"

Its Freemantle-class patrol boats will remain in service until early next century when their replacement by 12 off- shore patrol vessels is proposed. A fleet of six submarines will be maintained but naval manpower is to be reduced by some 1,000 men. The Army's regular manpower will be reduced by some 5,200, the current strength of the reserves (26,000) will be maintained and a new category of 'ready reserves' some 3,200 strong will be introduced. The Army's two regular brigades will be based in Northern Australia. Air Force regular manpower will reduce by some 4,200 and a 'ready reserve' will be introduced, there are no plans for new aircraft procurement. During the last year some acquisitions have been made including: five more S-70B-2 ASW helicopters, nine F/A-18 fighters and three more B-707 tankers. The Navy has retired two Paramatta-class frigates.","'133","'98.87695313","04597229108460033/layout.csv"

They agreed to place nuclear energy activities under international supervision. They have not yet decided to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but they said they would implement the provisions of the Treaty of Tlatelolco. In September 1990, President Collor had revealed that Brazil had been conducting a nuclear weapons development programme for 15 years. In a symbolic gesture he cast a spadeful of lime into a bore hole, 320 metres deep, which had been constructed, presumably, as an underground nuclear test site. Argentina has finally abandoned the Condor 2 missile develop- ment programme and has placed all associated facilities under civil control. Argentina has stated that it will abide by the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime and Brazil is considering following suit.","'13","'99.07226563","04597229108460034-1/layout.csv"

"6523","'10","'Text 38","'Recent trends in ballistic missile design have witnessed an increase in the number of warheads car- ried by each missile, and also an increase in the number of missiles deployed on each SSBN. If the most modern (and presumably most reliable and accurate) missiles are to be retained in service, with more of the older models being eliminated so as to remain within START limits, then the 6,000 allowed warheads will be concentrated on fewer delivery vehicles than the 1,600 allowed by the Treaty. 'Down-loading' is a way of obviating this result. This is the verifiable practice of reducing the number of warheads carried by a particular type of missile so that its attributable warhead count will be lower. At the beginning of the negotiations the two sides had widely divergent opinions on this issue. The US wished to restrict down-loading to 1,000 warheads taken from only one type of missile, while the Sov- iet Union was seeking a figure of 2,150 warheads from three types of missile (the Soviet Union has twice as many ballistic missiles with ten warheads than the US does). The compromise the Treaty reached is to allow 1,250 warheads to be down-loaded from three types of missile. The Soviet Union has already down-loaded its 224 SS-N-18 SLBMs (originally attributed with seven warheads) to only three warheads. However, this move will count as one of the three missile types the Soviet Union are allowed to down-load. The US objection to down-loading is that it provides an opportunity for covert violation of the Treaty and that down-loaded warheads could be replaced in a crisis. To obviate this, Minuteman III and SS-N-18 SLBMs (when down-loaded) must have the remaining warheads mounted in a redesigned RV SO that no spare space is available to allow the return of down-loaded war- heads. Other down-loaded missile types need not have RVs altered so long as only two warheads are removed. For example, down-loading the 96 SS-24 would give the USSR the potential to replace 192 warheads illegally in a crisis.","'61","'96.28906250","04597229108460035/layout.csv"
"6524","'10","'Text 39","'The last contentious issue was the reverse side of the down-loading coin: throw-weight and the defi- nition of what constitutes a new weapon. The US wanted to make it as hard and as expensive as poss- ible for the Soviet Union to adapt an existing missile type to carry additional warheads which it could then declare as a new missile type (and so avoid violating the rule which bans the testing of existing missiles with more warheads than their agreed START loading). The solution devised is to link the dif- ference in throw-weight to the definition of new missile types as opposed to modified versions. The Soviet proposal was that a 15% change in throw-weight of any missile would classify it as a new type, whereas the US proposed a 30% change. The compromise reached in the Treaty is that to be classified as a new missile it must differ from an existing type by at least 21% in throw-weight and 5% in length. In addition, a change from liquid to solid fuel or in the number of stages would also constitute a new missile type.

To counter this, NATO's conventional forces, in tandem with a theatre nuclear capability, in the context of the doctrine of Flexible Response, deterred both political intimidation, as well as a less probable attack on Western Europe. Indeed, it was hard to envisage the circumstances in which the Soviet Union, and its allies, would deliberately go to war with NATO. Yet with such large-scale forces facing each other across the inner-German border, there was always the risk that war could break out by accident, perhaps as a result of a superpower confrontation elsewhere in the world spilling over into Europe, where political signals could be misread and preparatory defensive moves seen as warlike intent. The recent events in Europe cul- minating in German unification in October 1990, the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviets' agreement to withdraw all their forces back to their homeland, have removed that threat. Nevertheless, despite the reduction in the political power of the Soviet military, the formulation of new, defensive military doctrines, and the requirements of the Conventional Armed Forces in Eur- ope (CFE) Treaty for major reductions in Soviet conventional strength, the USSR will remain the strongest military power on the European mainland. A major re-examination of NATO's military strategy has been under way since 1989; it was first publicly articulated in NATO's London Declar- ation of July 1990 and further detailed - some would say pre-empted - in the late spring of 1991 with the announcement of the formation of a NATO Rapid Reaction Force and the restructuring of Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT). NATO's new strategic concept should come up for discussion in November 1991.","'126","'99.21875000","04597229108460035/layout.csv"
"6589","'22","'Text 76","'At the same time, factors other than the removal of the threat from the East have intruded into the military debate. The Gulf crisis and the subsequent war with Iraq have provided a number of lessons which, where applicable, must influence NATO's new strategy and doctrine. As the Euro- pean Community (EC) moves towards a form of political union, there have been calls for it to embrace a common foreign and security policy and, ultimately, a common defence policy. Thus, by the spring of 1991, the broad outlines of a new NATO policy within a very different European security regime had begun to emerge. While new and old European institutions are competing for a permanent position in this new security regime (and both integrationists and their opponents are using the same arguments, based on Europe's response to the Gulf crisis and, more recently, to events in Yugoslavia, to support their case), NATO has remained as the dominant and most powerful institution, albeit one in search of a new role. In particular, NATO is the only organization that embodies the essential North American, transatlantic military link to European security. Equally, there is no doubt that in a post-Cold War Europe, NATO will increasingly share responsibilities with other multinational institutions. The EC may over time broaden its mandate to include a common European defence policy, though at present the Western European Union (WEU) could well evolve as the principal, but interim, European security pillar. Today the CSCE, the EC, the WEU and NATO all play a role in the security forum. However, if multinational mili- tary activity is needed, it is only NATO and the WEU that can play a co-ordinating role. The for- mer has no mandate for any operations outside the NATO region, while the latter has no command-and-control nor logistic infrastructure but can, of course, borrow these from NATO and/or its members.","'127","'96.97265625","04597229108460035/layout.csv"

The size of forces available to both sides was in the pro- cess of being drastically reduced.

One of the potential difficulties here for NATO is that crises arising in the Balkans or elsewhere in Eastern Europe would have to be considered as out-of-area insofar as they would not involve hostile Soviet military activity. A major difficulty in this regard is the political reluctance of continental Euro- pean nations to deploy conscript troops for OOA tasks. France found it difficult to deploy as strong a force as it would have liked to the Gulf. However, it is not only the possibility of OOA tasks which militates against conscript armies.

However, conscription is unlikely to be abandoned in many countries both for economic and historical reasons, and also because with- out a steady flow of conscripts there would be no pool of trained reservists. In some countries the point has been reached where any further reductions in the length of service has become militarily unacceptable. Belgium has announced plans to cut conscription to only eight months in 1993, and France will limit the period to ten months this year. If service cannot be further reduced, then the intake must be cut, introducing fresh problems of how to select those for service. Any form of selec- tive service will be more unpopular than a universal system, and will make the task of motivating and training conscripts more difficult.","'141","'98.82812500","04597229108460035/layout.csv"

NATO or Europe's Immediate Reaction Force must be multinational as it has a high political profile but, on the whole, the aim should be to maintain the existing national divisions. It has been suggested that a degree of national specialization should be introduced, with not all national forces fielding the full range of arms and services.

It was only in one area that they were not a success: three National Guard brigades were mobilized, but were never deployed to the Gulf. It is reported that their level of com- petence, after an intense period of retraining, was not acceptable and that there were serious lead- ership deficiencies. The leadership problem can be avoided by employing professional officers in command and key staff positions, but the question of training standards is more difficult to solve (the US National Guard carries out more training than do European reserve units). It will be pointed out that NATO will have sufficient warning time of any future Soviet threat in which to bring mobilized reserve formations up to standard, but this, of course, depends on prompt politi- cal decision-making.

Furthermore, scenarios which call for external intervention in Eastern Europe can now be readily imagined in which there would be no confrontation between the Soviet Union and the West. Monitoring of cease-fires, possible UN- or CSCE-mandated peace-keeping operations and humanitarian interventions (such as in Kurdistan) could well occur in the Balkans, outside the Cold War paradigms. The new landscape and the dis- tances involved have produced many new problems for military planners. For example, intelligence collection and target acquisition will be needed over a far wider area; the requirement for in-flight refuelling will greatly increase; the engineering tasks of maintaining main supply routes and of cre- ating obstacles will demand extra resources; and a greater logistic effort will be needed. Unless these problems are faced and, to some extent, resolved, NATO's reduced military posture will be far from credible, and a lack of credibility can only threaten NATO's continued existence. However, if the key characteristics - mobility, flexibility, lethality, sustainability, affordability and a highly sophisti- cated command-and-control infrastructure - are achieved, NATO will remain an essential part of the security order for the foreseeable future.
