<p>Throughout 1960 and the first half of 1961 the Soviet military policy followed the same course as that pursued by the United States in the mid-1950s and by Britain after 1957: an attempt was made to absorb the cost of technological development and new weapons by placing increased emphasis on nuclear fire power and reducing the amount of mobilized manpower. It was clear that the Soviet government had, at the end of 1959, reached a considered decision that their progress in missile technology, coupled with the demands of the economy, especially agriculture, for more men, justified such a policy. However, during July 1961, the Soviet government announced, in response to its own estimate of a darkening inter- national horizon, a revision of this emphasis on the deterrent effect of nuclear missiles, and has been anxious since then to make clear that it is building up the strength of virtually all its forces except surface ships. Under the law of January 15, 1960, the Soviet forces were to be reduced from 3,623,000 men to 2,423,000 men by the end of 1961, a reduction of 1,200,000 men over two years, but its suspension was announced on July 8, 1961. No official Soviet figures of the current strength of the forces has been published but it is not likely that more than 600,000 men were demobilized, principally in the ground forces. Thus the total strength of the forces in mid-1961 was about 3,000,000 men. In addition, it was announced on August 29, 1961, that the demobilization of certain categories of other ranks, whose period of military service was completed, had been suspended until the signature of a German peace treaty. When men called up in 1961 have completed their training and been absorbed into units at the end of the year, the effect of this decree (unless it is rescinded) will be to increase the size of the Soviet forces by up to 800,000 men, giving a total strength of perhaps 3,800,000 men - some five per cent larger than at the end of 1959.</p>
<p>The Soviet military budget for 1961 (calendar year) was set at 9,255 million roubles ($10,180 million) but it was announced on July 8, 1961, that it would be increased by one-third, i.e.&nbsp;3,114 million roubles ($3,415 million) to 12,339 million roubles ($13,573 million). In real terms, the total size of the augmented Soviet budget is estimated to be of the order of between $20,000 and $25,000 million. It is not likely that all this one-third increase can be spent during 1961, and only part of it will be needed to meet the increased bill for man- power; this suggests that it is also intended to accelerate weapons development and production.</p>

<p>Soviet policy statements continue to place marked emphasis on the development of long range missiles as a deterrent to aggression and a support to diplomacy. It is considered possible that the Soviet Union could, if the programme had rated a high enough priority, have by now built up a force of 200 ICBMs, the original three-stage liquid- fuelled missile which has been under development since the mid-fifties. The reasons that make it doubtful if they have actually created an operational force of this size are:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>the difficulties of building bases for so large a missile and their strategic vulnerability:</li>
<li>the fact that they now have a smaller second generation ICBM under active development which is likely to be easier to conceal:</li>
<li>the demands of the Soviet space and other programmes upon scientific man- power:</li>
</ol>
<p>Consequently the present figure of operational ICBMs is more likely to be in the neighbourhood of 50 than 200.</p>
<p>Unlike the United States Soviet policy places considerable emphasis on concealment of bases. Apart from the two main missile test centres near the Caspian Sea, it can be assumed only that the location of ICBM sites are influenced by the rail communications network.</p>
<p>As far as MRBMs are concerned, the figure of 200 has been quoted in the West, and in view of Soviet concentration on MRBMs this estimate seems reasonable. Soviet state- ments allege that they exist in considerable quantities, and since there are not the same indications of a need to decelerate their build-up in order to make room for a more advanced type as with ICBMs, this is very probably the case. From their ranges and from published Soviet statements, it is reasonably clear that Soviet policy is to site them near the western, southern and eastern borders of the Soviet Union, on the Pacific coast and in Siberia, so that they cover the main bases of Western medium range air and missile power from Britain to Okinawa and Japan.</p>
<p>The strategic missile forces are organized as an autonomous arm of the service, under the command of Marshal Kiril Moskalenko. In July 1961 Marshal Malinovsky, the Soviet Defence Minister, spoke of the reorganiza- tion of the Soviet forces to create tactical missile units capable of operating independently.</p>
<p>In spite of their concentration on rockets and ballistic missiles, the Russians have not neglected their Air Force, which comprises some 15,000 operational aircraft, organized into five major components, namely:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the long-range strategic bomber force;</li>
<li>the tactical, or front line, force which includes fighters and tactical bombers;</li>
<li>the fighter interceptor force;</li>
<li>the land-based fleet air arm;</li>
<li>the air transport force.</li>
</ol>
<p>The heavy bomber force has been kept at a considerably lower strength than that of the US Strategic Air Command, though the general lines of development, including stand-off bombs and missiles, are similar. On the other hand the Soviet Union has built up a very strong force of medium bombers suitable for use all over the Eurasian theatre and its coasts, and an efficient light bomber force. It seems probable that, partly as a result of service and industrial pressure, higher priority is being given to aircraft development than in the late fifties. The following gives some indication of Soviet strength in this field.</p>

<p>The Strategic Bomber Force consists mainly of the following aircraft:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>70 turbo-prop Bears* (TU 20); range 7,000 miles, bomb-load 20 tons, maximum speed 550 miles per hour, now able to carry two short range air to ground missiles similar to US Hound Dog.</li>

<li>1,000 twin-jet medium bomber Badgers (TU 16); range 3,500 miles, bomb-load 4-5 tons, speed 587 miles per hour, operational ceiling 40,000 feet. Delta-wing 4-jet Bounder (similar to but somewhat larger than the US B58), speed supersonic (probably Mach 2), range 1,650 miles; said to be capable of using grass runways; prototype displayed in 1961. New types shown at Tushino Air Show in 1961 included nine of a medium bomber, Blinder, somewhat similar to the US B58 and probably being developed for use with a longer range air to ground missile com-</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be made clear that this menagerie of names for Soviet aircraft is of NATO, not Soviet, origin.</p>
<p>parable to Skybolt, and capable of air refuelling.</p>
<p>A small proportion of this force is based on the Kola peninsula and in Siberia, while the rest is based in western and south-west Russia. Bisons and Badgers have also been adapted as tankers for in-flight refuelling.</p>

<p>It is clear that the tactical bomber forces are going through a much sharper period of transition than the heavy bomber forces, with older aircraft such as the turbo-jet Beagle and possibly the twin-jet Blowlamp and Backfin, being replaced. The earlier estimate of 4,000 operational aircraft is therefore now too high. The principal tactical bombers under development had been (a) the supersonic twin-jet Blowlamp, comparable to the RAF Canberra, with a high altitude range of 745 miles and a speed of 750 miles per hour (this was not displayed at the 1961 Air Show), and the twin-jet Backfin with a speed of 800 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Effort now seems to be concentrated on a new twin-jet ground attack aircraft with transonic capabilities and a wide radius of action which, like the new all-weather fighter, seems to be an improved version of Flash- is provisionally known as Flashlight B.</p>

<p>No official figures of the Soviet Army have been published but with the partial arresting of demobilization and the retention of the 1961 conscripts its total size is estimated at up to 2,500,000 (an increase of 250,000 on 1960). As a result of this year’s special measures it is organized in approximately 160 active line divisions (not all at full strength). An infantry division at war strength com- prises 12,000 men, an armoured division about 10,500 plus supporting artillery and anti-aircraft units. Most of the active divisions are armoured or mechanized.</p>
<p>In East Germany there are 10 tank divisions each with 400 tanks, and 10 mech- anized divisions, each with 250 tanks. All are operational and comprise a total of over 6,000 tanks. In Hungary and Poland there are 6 divisions. It is estimated that the Soviet Union has a total mobilization potential of 7 million men including all types of reservists.</p>
<p>The airborne forces of the Soviet Union total approximately 100,000 men formed in 9 divisions. The airborne troops are sup- ported by the transport fleet, which would enable about two divisions to be air-dropped or air-landed in any single operation.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Soviet Army has undergone a major reorganization to meet conditions of atomic warfare. Many of its units have been completely re-equipped twice over in the last ten years and, thanks to the introduction of modern weapons, its fire power has been vastly increased. Though the Soviet Union has not shown as much interest as the United States in the development of very low yield nuclear weapons for tactical purposes, nuclear warheads are available for many of the missiles mentioned below. Mr Khrushchev has hinted broadly that the Soviet forces in East Germany have tactical nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Soviet Army equipment includes:</p>

<p>The total tank strength of the Soviet Army is estimated at 20,000 front-line tanks and 15,000 second-line tanks. The new tanks which have been introduced into the Soviet armoured divisions are the T.54 medium tank, fitted with a 100 mm. gun, and the 54-ton heavy tank T.10, which mounts a 122 mm. gun.</p>

<p>The Soviet Army is very strong in artillery. Artillery weapons include the atomic 203 mm. cannon mounted on mobile platforms, with a range of 15 miles; and 240 mm. heavy mortars or unguided rockets with a range of 20 miles, together with many other types of mortars. Though many artillery tasks are to be performed by missiles, the Soviet Army still considers that many im- portant functions remain for rifled artillery.</p>

<p>the tactical units. Propelled by one liquid fuel engine, it has a range of 450 miles. It can be fired from a mobile ramp, is radio guided and can carry a nuclear warhead. There is a solid fuel ballistic missile with a range of 50 miles, which may be obsolete, and two smaller versions, carried on self- propelled launchers with ranges from 10 to 15 miles (equivalent to US Honest John). There is also a truck-launched missile with a range of 50 miles, which fires an HE warhead. A range of anti-tank missiles has also been developed.</p>

<p>The Soviet Navy, which is manned by about 500,000 officers and men, has increased from a total tonnage in 1940 of 600,000 to 1,600,000 tons today, which makes it the most powerful fleet in the world after the United States (4 million tons).</p>

<h3 data-number="2.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-submarines"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> (i) Submarines</h3>
<p>The main strength of the Soviet Navy lies in the submarine fleet.</p>
<p>The submarine force is generally estimated to comprise at least 430 units, of which 85 are based in the Baltic, 65 in the Black Sea, 140 in the Arctic, 120 in the Far East. Eight formerly based in the Mediterranean, on the Albanian ports of Durazzo and Valona, have been withdrawn. It is expected that in the foreseeable future, 75 per cent of the submarine fleet will con- sist of ocean-going craft of which a propor- tion will be atomic powered. At the moment, Russia has 6 atomic powered submarines in various stages of construction of which one or two may be at sea. The following are details of the conven- tionally powered submarine fleet: The F class is about 300 feet long, has a displacement of 2,000 tons, and a large radius of action. At least 10 of these are in service. The G class is 310 feet long and has a submerged displacement of 2,700 tons. It has a very large conning tower for the vertical launching of an unknown number of missiles which are fired when on the surface.</p>
<p>The W class is 245 feet long with a 1,050 tons displacement. It has a speed of 16 knots on the surface and 13 knots submerged, and a radius of action of 10,000 miles. There are about 130 of these in service. The Z class is 290 feet long with a sub- merged displacement of 2,600 tons. It is capable of 20 knots on the surface and 13 knots submerged, with a radius in excess of 20,000 miles. There are at least 20 of these in service. A small number have been con- verted to fire missiles, probably in a manner similar to the G class. They are stationed principally in the Baltic and the Far East. The K and Q type, which were built between 1945 and 1955, are medium range vessels; their radius of action is about 7,000 miles and their displacement varies from 1,400 to 680 tons.</p>

<p>(There are also a number of disguised trawlers used for radar and recon- naissance purposes.)</p>
<p>These are distributed more or less equally between the Baltic, Black Sea, Northern and Pacific fleets.</p>
<p>’Table 1</p>
<p>The cruisers are of three different types:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>17 Sverdlov, launched between 1951 and 1957, displacement 15,500 tons, speed 34 knots, armament 12 152 mm. guns and 32 anti-aircraft guns;</p></li>
<li><p>5 Chapayev class, completed between 1948 and 1951, of 11,500 tons displacement, with the same speed and armament as the Sverdlov;</p></li>
<li><p>6 Kirov and Gorki class, launched between 1936 and 1945, displacement 8,500 tons, speed 30 knots, armament 9 180 mm. guns and 20 anti-aircraft guns.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Four or more almost completed Sverdlov cruisers appear to have been scrapped.</p>
<p>The greater part of the destroyers are modern, having been constructed since 1950, and some are fitted with guided missiles.</p>
<p>Their displacement varies from 1,000 to 2,700 tons, and their speed from 28 to 38 knots.</p>

<p>There are believed to be two types. One has a range of about 100 miles and the other of about 400 miles. The 100 miles range missile is believed to be solid fuelled and can be fired either from a surface craft or a surfaced submarine. The 400-mile missile is designed for submarines but can only be fired from the surface.</p>
<p>Soviet claims to have an equivalent of the Polaris missile, which can be fired from a submerged submarine, are misleading.</p>

<p>The chief concern of United States defence in the eventuality of a general war will be a surprise attack by nuclear-armed ICBMs. For this, it is developing forces which can survive and respond to a first attack. Strategic Air Command is divided into</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the Fifth Air Force with Headquarters in California, and the Second and Eighth Air Force with Headquarters in Louisiana and Massachusetts.</p></li>
<li><p>the First Missile Division with Head- quarters in California.</p></li>
<li><p>the 16th Air Force in Spain, the 7th Air Division in the UK, and the 3rd Air Division based on Guam. Each of these overseas units operates several advance bases.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Strategic Aircraft. The SAC has over 1,500 bombers capable of delivering nuclear bombs. Of these, some 1,000 are B.47s, and 600 are long-range B.52s based in the United States. Both types of aircraft use in-flight refuelling to extend their range. The B.58,</p>
<p>of which there are between thirty and forty now in service, will partially replace the B.47.</p>
<p>One-third of these forces is now kept con- tinuously on ‘ground alert’, which will enable them to leave their bases within 15 minutes of receiving warning of attack. The propor- tion is to be increased to one-half by the middle of 1962.</p>
<p>Missiles. The First Missile Division oper- ates the Atlas and Titan ICBMs. The present long-term programme comprises 25 Atlas and Titan squadrons, including 6 Atlas squadrons with 12 missiles permanently on launchers. By early in 1962 three main bases of the present ‘soft’ Vandenberg and Warren types will have been completed. By then there will also be one ‘hard’ Titan base (at Denver, Colorado) and two more ‘semi-hard’ Atlas bases. This will mean that 54 Atlas and nine Titans are operational.</p>
<p>The Snark guided missile is to be with- drawn by the end of 1961.</p>

<p>United States: The Strategic Army Corps, which forms the main element of the United States strategic reserve, consists of two airborne divisions and one infantry division, totalling some 110,000 men. The infantry division is supported by elements armed with the Honest John field missile. There is a possibility that one of these divisions will be sent to join the 7th Army in Europe, in which case it would be replaced in the US by a National Guard division. The President has announced his intention of adding 3 divisions to the Continental Army Com- mand and assigning them to STRAC by the middle of 1962.</p>
<p>The total number of men in the US Continental Army Command is at present about 250,000.</p>
<p>United Kingdom: The elements of the Strategic Reserve which are assigned for reinforcement of the BAOR consist of the main part of the Parachute Brigade based in the UK, which will operate in association with some infantry battalions, and a division of two infantry brigades at present being built up in England.</p>
<p>France: There are now two divisions stationed in France and two in Algeria. These are considered as reinforcements for the Central Area of NATO in the event of hostilites.</p>
<p>Canada: Two brigade groups stationed in Canada are earmarked for the Supreme Commander in the event of hostilities.</p>

<p>Allied Command has its headquarters near Paris and stretches from northern Norway to the southern frontiers of Turkey and the Mediterranean. The Air Forces in Europe of</p>
<p>the NATO Powers can muster 5,000 tac- tical aircraft which operate from some 220 operational bases. Nearly 5,000 miles of fuel supply systems are in service for the supply of the forces, 26,500 miles of com-</p>
<p>munications and signal network are in use, and an effective early warning radar system has been developed. Deployment of tactical nuclear weapons into NATO land forces is now almost complete. They are principally the Honest John missile, but include some Corporals and 280 mm. cannon. Joint pro- duction in European NATO countries of two anti-aircraft weapons Hawk and Side- winder is continuing, as well as three types of aircraft, the F104G Starfighter, the Breguet Atlantic, and the Fiat G91 light fighters.</p>
<p>Allied Command Europe is divided into the following subordinate commands:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Allied Forces Central Europe has its headquarters in Fontainebleau and com- prises 23 divisions (out of the required 30) assigned to the Supreme Commander as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p>Out of these forces, a small mobile task force of 5 battalions with a nuclear capa- bility has been created as a tactical reserve for NATO as a whole.</p>
<p>The tactical air forces available in the central area consist of some 3,000 aircraft, of which 250 US fighter-bombers and a smaller number of British Canberras, now being replaced by Vulcan 2s, and Valiants have a nuclear capability and a range which would cover important sections of eastern Russia.</p>
<p>The tactical air forces are organized into two main commands, 2nd ATAF (under British command) in northern Germany, which includes British, Dutch, Belgian and</p>
<p>’Table 1</p>
<p>German forces; 4th ATAF (under Ameri- can command) in southern Germany, in- cludes American, Canadian, French and German forces.</p>
<ol start="2" type="i">
<li><p>Allied Forces Northern Europe has its headquarters at Kolsaas in Norway and is responsible for the defence of Norway, Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein and the Baltic approaches. It comprises approximately one Norwegian and one Danish division, as well as the tactical air forces of these countries and their naval forces. One German division in Schleswig-Holstein and units of the German Baltic fleet are also committed to AFNORTH.</p></li>
<li><p>Allied Forces Southern Europe has its headquarters in Naples and is responsible for the defence of the Mediterranean NATO area. The forces allocated to this command comprise 14 divisions from Tur- key, 9 from Greece and 7 from Italy, as well as the tactical air forces of these countries which comprise some 1,000 aircraft, and some naval forces. US forces in Italy and Greece also operate some Honest John guided missile units in conjunction with national forces. The US Sixth Fleet would come under command of AFSOUTH in time of war.</p></li>
<li><p>Allied Forces Mediterranean has its headquarters at Malta and is primarily responsible for safeguarding communica- tions through and across the Mediterranean. Six areas are under national control, two British, one French, one Italian, one Greek, one Turkish. There is also a special subor- dinate command for submarine forces in the Mediterranean. The national fleets of Italy, Greece and Turkey, together with a propor- tion of the British and - normally the French fleets, go to make up this command.</p></li>

<p>Unlike the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic does not have forces permanently</p>
<p>assigned to him in peacetime. The eight NATO maritime powers bordering the Atlantic maintain control of their forces in peacetime, but have earmarked certain of them for SACLANT in the event of war.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, in wartime, SACLANT’s missions are to strike at enemy naval bases and airfields with aircraft from the Striking Fleet Atlantic, to main- tain control of the Atlantic sea lanes, to prevent enemy forces from striking at European and North American land bases from the sea, and to support the Allied Command Europe. To the Striking Fleet Atlantic would be assigned a considerable proportion of American and British attack aircraft carriers.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The surface ships in the navies of the eight Atlantic maritime nations include about 25 aircraft carriers. Of these, six American carriers have been converted for anti-submarine duties. Britain has 3 carriers, France, Canada and the Nether- lands have one each. The carriers designated for anti-submarine missions carry American and/or Canadian S2F Trackers, British Fairey Gannets, largely replaced by Sea Vixens, and Scimitars and Wessex helicopters, French 1050 Alizes and anti-submarine helicopters. In all, NATO anti-submarine carriers could embark about 400 to 500 aircraft of various types.</p></li>
<li><p>Other surface ships in these national navies include about 440 destroyers, frigates and destroyer escorts. (The United States has over 260 of these types, the Royal Navy has over 47 to contribute, while the other navies have lesser numbers.) A considerable proportion of these anti-submarine ships are of World War II construction but many have been modernized and progress is being made in building replacements.</p></li>
<li><p>With regard to submarines the trend in most navies has been to change their role from commerce destruction to anti-sub- marine warfare, although they retain the former mission in addition. Of the 16 nuclear and 243 conventional submarines belonging to NATO maritime countries, well over 150 would be available for anti-submarine duties in the Atlantic.</p></li>

<p>North American Air Defence Command is maintained under an agreement between the United States and Canada, which integrates the Canadian and American Air Defence Commands. The Headquarters are at Col- orado Springs. Canadian Air Defence Command cur- rently has nine squadrons of CF-100 inter- ceptors armed with air-to-air missiles. American Air Defence Command weapons consist of F-104 all-weather interceptors and Bomarc missiles. The defence of American cities depends mainly on 15 Nike-Hercules ground-to-air missile units. In 1962, Canada should receive 2 Bomarc missile units for which the sites in Quebec and Ontario, are ready, and for the opera- tion of which 500 men have been trained. These defences are supported by an ex- tended radar system. Supplementing the BMEWS station in Greenland and Alaska, there are three lines of radar stations in Canada, and the ‘contiguous radar system’ in the United States is supported by ships and radar aircraft in the Pacific and the Atlantic and a number of ‘Texas Tower’ radar stations near the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>The surface and submarine forces are supported by long-range patrol aircraft such as the American Neptune, the British Shack- leton, and Canadian Argus. In all, there are about 375 maritime patrol aircraft available for anti-submarine service in the eight NATO countries bordering the Atlantic.</p>

<p>F.101 Voodoo long-range fighter. Cruising speed 1,200 m.p.h. Range 1,000 miles.</p>
<p>F.102 Dagger. Supersonic all- weather interceptor (principally for North American Air De- fence).</p>
<p>F.104 Starfighter. Has reached speeds of 1,400 m.p.h. and height of 91,000 feet.</p>
<p>F.105 Thunderbird. Single-seater fighter-bomber. A more power- ful version is now being pro- duced, able to refuel in flight and carry heavier payloads of non-nuclear warheads, e.g.&nbsp;the Bullpup or Sidewinder missiles.</p>
<p>F.106 Dart. All-weather intercep- tor, with speed of over 1,500 m.p.h.</p>
<p>(see strategic forces, page 8) The B.47 has a range of 3,250 miles. The B.52, which can carry the Hound Dog air-to- surface missile in addition to free-falling bombs, has a range of 6,000 miles, with a speed of over 650 m.p.h. Both can ex- tend their range by in-flight refuelling, which is provided</p>
<p>Transport: 129 new long-range airlift aircraft are to be pro- cured by the middle of 1962. The Military Air Transport Ser- vice at present comprises about 480 4-engined piston aircraft designed for cargo and troops.</p>

<p>The members of SEATO are Australia, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philip- pine Republic, Thailand, the United King- dom and the United States. SEATO does not yet have a centralized command struc- ture and forces remain under national con- trol. SEATO co-operation is concerned not only with military defence against aggression, but also with the problem of subversion.</p>
<p>The main strategic forces are provided by the US Seventh Fleet (see strategic forces,</p>
<p>p. 9) based on Manila, units of Strategic Air Command based on Okinawa and Guam and the British Far Eastern Fleet based on Singapore.. The Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaya includes British, Austra- lian and New Zealand battalions and sup- porting units, and Australian and New Zealand naval and tactical air units, but the Malay Federation has recently made it clear that bases in Malaya would not be available for SEATO operations.</p>
